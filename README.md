Expert.Sub.Slope1 code has been associated to find a feasible solution of the underdetermined linear system equations with bounded variables, that is,
find V
s.t. SV=0,
     L<=V<=U.
Please set your file name, your sheet and your data range for matrix S on lines 8-10.
Please set  your data range for lower bound matrix L on the line 18.
Please set  your data range for lower bound matrix U on the line 25.

Input files must be in .xlsx (or .xls) format.
